<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>This pamphlet about the most important compositions
in which Brahms employs the orchestra, like its
predecessor about Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies, makes no
claim to originality and no secret of indebtedness to
treatises that are open to us all. It is addressed to the
radio audience of The Philharmonic-Symphony Society
of New York, and its only object is to present in concise
form some information concerning an inexhaustible
subject that radio listeners may find of service.</p>

<h1 title="">BRAHMS
<br />and some of his works</h1>
<p class="center">By
<br />PITTS SANBORN</p>
<p class="tb">In the then free city of Hamburg Johannes Brahms
was born on May 7, 1833. His parents were in humble
circumstances, and Johannes was born in a poor part of
the city. But his father was a well-trained musician and
an accomplished double-bass player, and his mother,
seventeen years his father&rsquo;s senior, was a woman of fine
spirit and unusual intelligence.</p>
<p>From an early age Johannes was clearly destined for a
musical career, and at six he had already begun to learn
the rudiments of music from his father, who purposed
making an orchestral player of him. When he was eight
he began to take piano lessons of Otto Cossel, his father
feeling he had nothing more to teach the child. Cossel
pronounced him an excellent pupil, but complained that
he wasted time on his &ldquo;everlasting composing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two years later Cossel, convinced that he deserved
more advanced instruction, took him to his own teacher,
Eduard Marxsen, the royal music director in the adjacent
city of Altona. Marxsen accepted the new pupil unwillingly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
but presently he was impressed with the keenness
of the boy&rsquo;s mind. Beginning with piano lessons, he later
studied composition, and Marxsen, thorough about all
instruction, encouraged him to compose as well as to
perfect himself as a pianist. Incidentally, Johannes
became a great reader of books.</p>
<p>At the age of eleven Johannes appeared, together with
his father, as pianist at a private subscription concert
organized to raise money to continue his education.
Then and there an impresario wanted to engage him for
a concert tour that was to include America. But Cossel
protested effectively against his being exploited as a
prodigy. Nevertheless, the Brahms family was so poor
at this time that Johannes was obliged to add to their
income by playing the piano in sailors&rsquo; resorts. This
work, which often lasted into the morning hours, affected
his health adversely.</p>
<p>He continued to compose, however, and a turning point
came when he had the chance to undertake a tour with
the young Hungarian violinist Eduard Remenyi. In the
course of this association he not only got acquainted with
Hungarian national dances, which were to influence considerably
his compositions, but he met a variety of important
musicians, among them Joachim, Liszt, Cornelius,
Raff, Berlioz, and, above all, Robert and Clara Schumann.
Thereafter Robert Schumann, until his tragic death, was
the young man&rsquo;s champion and mentor, and Clara Schumann
became his devoted lifelong friend.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in D Minor, No. 1, Op. 15</h3>
<p>Although Brahms&rsquo;s earlier works included not only compositions
for the piano, songs, and chamber music, but
also the Serenade for Full Orchestra in D, it was not till
the spring and summer of 1854 that we find him engaged
on a symphony. This made such progress that in January,
1855, he could write to Robert Schumann: &ldquo;I have been
trying my hand at a symphony during the past summer,
have even orchestrated the first movement and composed
the second and third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony was never completed as such, however,
but turned into a sonata for two pianos. Still, this was
not the end of the matter. Advised that the musical
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
contents of the sonata deserved a more imposing form,
Brahms was persuaded to mould the material into a
concerto. Accordingly the first two movements took up a
corresponding position in the D minor Piano Concerto,
the third becoming the chorus &ldquo;Behold All Flesh&rdquo; in
&ldquo;A German Requiem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first public performance of the concerto took place
in Hanover on January 22, 1859, at one of the Court
subscription concerts in the Royal Theatre, Brahms being
the pianist, Joachim the conductor. Though the cognoscenti
admired the new work, the public in general found
it a hard nut to crack. And as a matter of notorious fact
the concerto was to make its way slowly. Only in the
present century, for instance, has it won full recognition
in this country.</p>
<p>The first movement (Maestoso, D minor, 6-8) has a
long orchestral introduction before the piano enters. Over
a roll on the kettledrums the chief subject is announced
in the strings:</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig2">
<a href="music/img001.mid"><img src="images/img001.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="216" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img001.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The second subject is given out by the piano in F major.
The movement ends with an extended and brilliant coda.
The second movement (Adagio, D major, 6-4) bears
in the manuscript score the motto: &ldquo;Benedictus qui venit
in nomine Domini.&rdquo; Max Kalbeck, Brahm&rsquo;s biographer,
says that this inscription refers to Robert Schumann,
whose death had affected Brahms deeply and whom he
had sometimes addressed as &ldquo;Mynheer Domine.&rdquo; The
first theme, to which the fanciful may fit the Latin words,
appears in the strings and bassoons, to be taken up later
by the solo instrument. The movement has a contrasting
middle section. The finale is a long and elaborate Rondo
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
(Allegro non troppo, D minor, 2-4), ending in a majestic
and triumphant coda.</p>
<p>This concerto, owing to the exceeding prominence given
to the orchestra, really ranks as an orchestral composition,
and it was years before Brahms attempted another on a
like scale. In 1873 he brought out the &ldquo;Variations on a
Theme by Haydn.&rdquo; Though meanwhile he had written
copiously, only the two modest Serenades had been composed
for orchestra.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Variations for Orchestra on a Theme by Haydn, Op. 56<span class="mixcase">a</span></h3>
<p>Now a permanent resident of Vienna, Brahms spent
his summer holiday in 1873 at Tutzing on the Starnbergersee
in southern Bavaria. A version of the Variations
for two pianos Brahms marked &ldquo;Tutzing, July, 1873.&rdquo;
Whether it was the first of the two versions we do not
know. On November 2 the orchestral version was
brought out in Vienna at a Philharmonic Concert, Otto
Dessoff conducting.</p>
<p>The theme by Haydn comes from an unpublished
divertimento for wind instruments, preserved at the State
Library in Berlin, which is inscribed &ldquo;Divertimento mit
dem Chorale St. Antoni.&rdquo; Though the melody of the
chorale is usually supposed to be Haydn&rsquo;s own, we cannot
be sure that he had not taken it from a chorale that has
now disappeared.</p>
<p>In Haydn&rsquo;s key of B-flat major the theme</p>

<p>is given out andante in 2-4 time and repeated. Eight
variations follow:</p>
<p>I. (Poco piu animato, major mode). Throughout the
initial variation the concluding notes of the introduction
ring like a tolling of bells.</p>
<p>II. (Pi&ugrave; vivace, minor mode). The clarinets and bassoons
take the lead. The violins supply an arpeggio figure.</p>
<p>III. (Con moto, major mode). The theme in this
tranquil section is given first to the oboes and bassoons.</p>
<p>IV. (Andante con moto, minor mode). New melodic
material enters. Oboe and horn announce the theme.</p>
<p>V. (Vivace, major mode). Flutes, oboes, and bassoons
have the melody.</p>
<p>VI. (Vivace, minor mode). Brilliant like its predecessor,
this variation introduces a new figure.</p>
<p>VII. (Grazioso, major mode). In Siciliano rhythm (6-8),
the seventh variation is generally regarded as the crowning
glory of the set. Against a descending scale for first violins
and clarinets, violas and piccolo play the melody. Then
the first violins give out a theme whose first four notes
provide the movement with its rhythmic basis. There is
a wealth of fascinating detail.</p>
<p>VIII. (Presto non troppo, minor mode). In a mysterious
whisper of muted strings the last variation leads darkly
to the Finale. (Andante, major mode). A ground bass,
five measures long and repeated twelve times below a
variety of harmonies, occupies much of this summing up.
At a signal from the triangle an outburst of vernal life
sweeps through the orchestra, ending with the theme in
fortissimo proclamation.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony in C Minor, No. 1, Op. 68</h3>
<p>Owing, no doubt, to the experience with the symphony
that at last became a piano concerto, Brahms was cautious
about trying his hand again at a symphony. In 1862 he
had made, however, a version of the Symphony in C
minor, without the introduction, of which he wrote to his
friend Albert Dietrich, the composer. According to his
biographer Walter Niemann, he once remarked it was
&ldquo;no laughing matter&rdquo; to write a symphony after
Beethoven, and the same authority points out that when
he had finished the first movement of the C minor symphony
he declared to another friend, Hermann Levi, the
noted conductor: &ldquo;I shall never compose a symphony!
You have no conception of how the likes of us feel when
we hear the tramp of a giant like him (Beethoven) behind
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">BRAHMS&rsquo;S BIRTHPLACE IN HAMBURG</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>This extreme modesty persisted, for Niemann assures
us that ten years after the completion of the Fourth
Symphony Brahms alluded to that majestic work as
&ldquo;halbsch&uuml;rig&rdquo; (&ldquo;mediocre&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Opening Brahms&rsquo;s series of four, the Symphony in C
minor was given for the first time on November 4, 1876,
at the Grand Ducal Theatre, Karlsruhe. It seems that
immediately before the orchestral parts were copied for
the first rehearsal Brahms abridged the Andante and the
Allegretto, saying that he had the Finale to think of.
Otto Dessoff, who had left Vienna for Karlsruhe, conducted
the performance, as he had done in the case of the &ldquo;Haydn&rdquo;
variations at Vienna. Brahms had a low opinion of him.
He had even written while Dessoff was still in Vienna:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Dessoff is absolutely not the right man for this,
the only enviable post in Vienna. There are special
reasons why he continues to beat time, but not a soul
approves. Under him the orchestra has positively deteriorated.&rdquo;
Three days after the premi&egrave;re at Karlsruhe
the symphony was repeated at Mannheim, this time with
the composer as conductor.</p>
<p>At first the C minor Symphony won little more than
a success of esteem. Even Hanslick, Brahms&rsquo;s Viennese
prophet, was not wholly enthusiastic. Typical is the judgment
expressed by the revered John S. Dwight in his
Journal of Music after the symphony had been made
known to Boston, when it was scarcely fourteen months
old. He felt it as something &ldquo;depressing and unedifying,
a work coldly elaborated, artificial; earnest, to be sure,
in some sense great, and far more satisfactory than any
symphony by Raff or any others of the day which we
have heard, but not to be mentioned in the same day
with any symphony by Schumann, Mendelssohn, or the
great one by Schubert, not to speak of Beethoven&rsquo;s....
Our interest in it will increase, but we foresee the limit;
and certainly it cannot be popular; it will not be loved
like the dear masterpieces of genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this dark prophecy, the symphony has long
been one of the most popular, and it is now the established
fashion to find in it not only magnitude and ruggedness,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
but pathos, tenderness, and a profound humanity.</p>
<p>A portentous introduction (Un poco sostenuto, C
minor, 6-8) prefaces the first movement (Allegro, C minor,
6-8). The first theme is given out by the violins in the
fifth measure. The second theme (E-flat major) appears
in the woodwind. The character of the movement is
austere and epic.</p>
<p>The second movement (Andante sostenuto, E major,
3-4) is imbued with a profound lyricism, which flowers
into some of the loveliest pages in all Brahms.</p>
<p>Instead of a scherzo there follows a movement marked
&ldquo;Un poco allegretto e grazioso&rdquo; (A-flat major, 2-4), which
Grove aptly characterizes as &ldquo;a sort of national tune or
Volkslied of simple sweetness and grace.&rdquo; The opening
subject is sung first by the clarinet. The place of a trio is
delightfully filled by a contrasting middle section (B
major, 6-8).</p>
<p>The stupendous finale begins with an introductory
section (Adagio, C minor, 4-4) that touches briefly on
thematic material to be developed later, and here that
distinguished American critic, the late William Foster
Apthorp, must have our attention:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the thirtieth measure the tempo changes to
pi&ugrave; andante, and we come upon one of the most poetic
episodes in all Brahms. Amid hushed, tremulous harmonies
in the strings, the horn and afterward the flute
pour forth an utterly original melody, the character of
which ranges from passionate pleading to a sort of wild
exultation according to the instrument that plays it.</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig5">
<a href="music/img004.mid"><img src="images/img004.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="200" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img004.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The coloring is enriched by the solemn tones of the trombones,
which appear for the first time in this movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ticklish work trying to dive down into a composer&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
brain and surmise what special outside source his
inspiration may have had; but one cannot help feeling
that this whole wonderful episode may have been suggested
to Brahms by the tones of the Alpine horn as it
awakens the echoes from mountain after mountain on
some of the high passes in the Bernese Oberland. This is
certainly what the episode recalls to anyone who has ever
heard those poetic tones and their echoes. A short,
solemn, even ecclesiastical interruption by the trombones
and bassoons is of more thematic importance. As the
horn tones gradually die away and the cloudlike harmonies
in the string sink lower and lower&mdash;like mist veiling the
landscape&mdash;an impressive pause ushers in the Allegro non
troppo, ma con brio (in C major, 4-4 time).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the rest of the movement Apthorp adds:
&ldquo;The introductory Adagio has already given us mysterious
hints at what is to come; and now there bursts forth in
the strings the most joyous, exuberant Volkslied melody,
a very Hymn to Joy, which in some of its phrases,
as it were unconsciously and by sheer affinity of nature,
flows into strains from the similar melody in the Finale
of Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth Symphony. One cannot call it
plagiarism: it is two men saying the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to this symphony, Hans von B&uuml;low has
often been misquoted. As Philip Hale puts it: &ldquo;Ask a
music-lover, at random, what von B&uuml;low said about
Brahms&rsquo;s Symphony in C minor and he will answer:
&lsquo;He called it the Tenth Symphony.&rsquo; If you inquire into
the precise meaning of this characterization, he will
answer: &lsquo;It is the symphony that comes worthily after
Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth&rsquo;; or, &lsquo;It is worthy of Beethoven&rsquo;s
ripest years,&rsquo; or in his admiration he will go so far as to
say: &lsquo;Only Brahms or Beethoven could have written it&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What B&uuml;low actually set down in words was this:
&ldquo;First after my acquaintance with the Tenth Symphony,
alias Symphony No. 1, by Johannes Brahms, that is since
six weeks ago, have I become so intractable and so hard
against Bruch pieces and the like. I call Brahms&rsquo;s first
symphony the Tenth, not as though it should be put
after the Ninth; I should put it between the Second and
the &lsquo;Eroica,&rsquo; just as I think by the First Symphony should
be understood not the First of Beethoven but the one
composed by Mozart which is known as the &lsquo;Jupiter&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony in D Major, No. 2, Op. 73</h3>
<p>Having launched a first symphony, Brahms composed
a second within a year. However, he kept the writing of
it so secret that nobody, we are told, knew anything about
it till it was completed. Then, when he did divulge the
secret, he was very demure. In September, 1877, he wrote
to Dr. Billroth of Vienna, who was a patron of music as
well as an eminent surgeon: &ldquo;I do not know whether I
have a pretty symphony; I must inquire of skilled persons.&rdquo;
He meant Clara Schumann, Otto Dessoff, and Ernest
Frank. Mme. Schumann recorded on September 19 that
he had written out the first movement. Early in the
following month he played it to her, as well as part of
the finale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had delighted in mystifying his friends
before letting them hear any of the work by describing
it as gloomy and awesome and referring to its key as F
minor instead of D major. To Elisabeth von Herzogenberg
he wrote in November, 1877: &ldquo;The new symphony is
merely a <i>Sinfonie</i>, and I shall not need to play it to you
beforehand. You have only to sit down at the piano,
put your small feet on the two pedals in turn, and strike
the chord of F minor several times in succession, first in the
treble, then in the bass, fortissimo and pianissimo, and
you will gradually gain a vivid impression of my &lsquo;latest&rsquo;.&rdquo;
The day before the first performance he again wrote to
Frau von Herzogenberg: &ldquo;The orchestra here play my
new symphony with crepe bands on their sleeves because
of its dirge-like effect. It is to be printed with a black
edge, too.&rdquo; Such were Brahms&rsquo;s little jokes.</p>
<p>When the symphony was actually performed in public,
at a concert of the Vienna Philharmonic, under the direction
of Hans Richter, Brahms&rsquo;s friends found it anything
but a lugubrious and forbidding composition. The date
of that first performance, by the way, is variously given as
December 20, 24, and 30, 1877, and January 10, 1878, of
which December 30 is favored. The success with the
audience at the premi&egrave;re was progressive. If at first the
response was lukewarm, when the Allegretto grazioso was
reached there came an insistent demand that it be repeated,
an encore which Richter granted.</p>
<p>Today the Second Symphony is usually regarded as
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
lyrical, suave, even Mendelssohnian, a work of serenity
and sweet peacefulness, bearing much the same relation
to the austere, dramatic, and often tempestuous First
Symphony that Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pastoral&rdquo; bears to the
preceding Fifth, with its conflict between Man and Fate.</p>
<p>Still, not everybody views the D major symphony in
quite this gentle light. Walter Niemann in his life of
Brahms maintains that the D major is by no means a
blameless, agreeable, cheerfully sunlit idyl. Nothing, he
declares, could be further from the truth! He describes
the period between the 1860&rsquo;s and 1880&rsquo;s as having a
heart-rending pathos and a monumental grandeur as its
artistic ideal. &ldquo;Nowadays,&rdquo; he goes on, &ldquo;regarding things
from a freer and less prejudiced point of view, we are
fortunately able to detect far more clearly the often oppressive
spiritual limitations, moodiness, and atmosphere
of resignation in such pleasant, apparently cheerful, and
anacreontic[!] works as Brahms&rsquo;s Second Symphony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He points out that the Second, though nominally in the
major, has a veiled, indetermined, Brahmsian major-minor
character, hovering between the two modes.
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;this undercurrent of tragedy in the
Second Symphony, quiet and slight though it may be, is
perceptible to a fine ear in every movement.&rdquo; And he
sums up the whole matter by putting down the Second
Symphony as really a &ldquo;great, wonderful, tragic idyl, as
rich in sombre and subdued color as it is in brightness.&rdquo;
He even sees mysterious visions of Wagner, who was by
no means a friend of Brahms, in the mystic woodland
atmosphere of the work, recalling &ldquo;Das Rheingold&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Siegfried,&rdquo; and in many sombre and even ghostly
passages.</p>
<p>The opening movement (Allegro non troppo, D major,
3-4) is remarkable for the lyricism of its themes. After
the so-called fundamental motive of the first measure
(&rsquo;cellos and double-basses), the melodious chief theme
is given out by horns and woodwind.</p>

</div>
<p>A graceful subsidiary theme is heard in the violins. The
second subject, nostalgic in its wistfulness, appears in the
violas and &rsquo;cellos. A horn solo in the coda evokes the
mystery of forest deeps from an old and bardic time.</p>
<p>The second movement (Adagio non troppo, B major,
4-4) is of a profoundly romantic and yet somewhat elusive
character. Not a scherzo, but rather the old-time minuet,
is hinted at in the third movement (Allegretto grazioso&mdash;<i>Quasi
Andantino</i>,&mdash;G major, 3-4). The engaging melody</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig8">
<a href="music/img007.mid"><img src="images/img007.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="195" /></a>

</div>
<p>is sung immediately by the oboes over chords in the
clarinets and bassoons and pizzicato arpeggios in the
&rsquo;cellos. Each of the two trios that the movement boasts
is a variation on this theme. An acute critic has said
of the Allegretto: &ldquo;Like many well-known things, it is
not always remembered in its full variety and range, or
we should hear less of its being too small for its place in a
big symphony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The finale (Allegro con spirito, D major, 2-2) is in
sonata form. Thematically it is both rich in invention
and reminiscent of passages in the earlier movements.
A kinship to the finale of Haydn&rsquo;s last &ldquo;London&rdquo; symphony
has also been remarked. Of the four movements
this Allegretto con spirito is the most vigorous and vivacious,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
concluding, after pages of Olympian struggle, in
a victorious coda of overwhelming brilliance.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D Major, Op. 77</h3>
<p>P&ouml;rtschach-am-See, a picturesque place in Lower
Austria, on the W&ouml;rthersee, near the Italian frontier,
appealed to Brahms as ideal for a summer holiday. To
Hanslick he once wrote that the air at Portschach was
so charged with melodies that he must &ldquo;be careful not
to tread on them.&rdquo; There he began the D major symphony
and composed (in 1878) the violin concerto (also
in D major).</p>
<p>And even now, with his characteristic modesty and
still uncertain about the value of his own work, he could
say in a letter to Elisabeth von Herzogenberg, the day
announced for the first performance of the violin concerto
being only a fortnight away: &ldquo;Joachim is coming here
and I shall have a chance to try the concerto through
with him and so to decide for or against a public performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hanslick once quite justly called this concerto &ldquo;the
ripe fruit of the friendship between Joachim and Brahms.&rdquo;
For Joachim it was written and to him it stands dedicated.
He, furthermore, was the soloist when at a Gewandhaus
Concert in Leipzig, on January 1, 1879, it was given to
the world. A local reviewer, on good terms with both the
composer and the violinist, remarked after the first performance
that only too evidently Joachim found the solo
part extremely difficult.</p>
<p>The influence of Joachim on the concerto must have
been considerable, for Brahms often consulted him with
regard to the practicability of this or that passage, and
he supplied not only a cadenza but the fingering and the
indications for bowing as well. Subsequently Joachim
went still further. After he had played the concerto a
number of times in public, he advised Brahms to make
alterations in the score that he thought were required,
and Brahms consented to the alterations before the concerto
was published in October, 1879. To Brahms Joachim
wrote from London, where he had performed the work
twice with the Philharmonic Society:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With these exceptions the piece, especially the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
movement, pleases me more and more. The last two
times I played without notes. That a solo composition
has been performed at two London Philharmonic Concerts
in succession has happened in the history of the society
only once, when Mendelssohn played his G minor piano
concerto (manuscript).&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been pointed out that Brahms&rsquo;s biographers
disagree about the reception accorded the violin concerto
at the premi&egrave;re. Florence May quotes D&ouml;rffel, critic
of the Leipziger Nachrichten, as follows: &ldquo;Joachim played
with a love and devotion which brought home to us in
every measure the direct or indirect share he has had in
the work. As to the reception, the first movement was
too new to be distinctly appreciated by the audience,
the second made considerable way, the last aroused great
enthusiasm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max Kalbeck, a devotee of Brahms, declares: &ldquo;The
work was heard respectfully, but it did not awaken a
particle of enthusiasm. It seemed that Joachim had not
sufficiently studied the concerto or he was severely indisposed.
Brahms conducted with visible excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>J. A. Fuller-Maitland emphasizes Brahms&rsquo;s going back
to the tradition of the older concerto form in giving a
long exposition of the material of the first movement
before the entry of the solo instrument. &ldquo;When the violin
does come in, it is with a kind of breathless passage, on
which there was some discussion between the composer
and Joachim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot fail to trace in the passages for solo the
special points in which Joachim was without a rival, such
as the handling of several parts and other things. The
absence of the slightest trace of passages written for mere
effect is as characteristic of the player as of the composer;
and, like the other concertos, the work for violin
is to be judged first and foremost as a composition, not
as a means of display.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Occasionally it may have happened that in the desire
to avoid the meretricious Brahms allowed himself to make
the violin part so harsh as almost to repel the general
public at first; even in the short time since the death of
Joachim, who was, of course, unrivalled in it, the work
has come increasingly into favor with violinists, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
nowadays even the prodigies are bold enough to attempt
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first movement of the concerto (Allegro non troppo,
D major, 3-4) has a chief subject of idyllic nature, announced
by violas, &rsquo;cellos, bassoons, and horns. The peak
of the movement comes with the merging of the cadenza
into the return of the first subject.</p>
<p>The second movement (Adagio, F major, 2-4) has been
compared to a serenade or a romanza. The principal
melody is sung first by an oboe, then in altered form
by the solo violin,</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig9">
<a href="music/img008.mid"><img src="images/img008.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="197" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img008.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>which also introduces an emotional and highly ornamented
second theme. After extended development the original
melody comes back in the solo instrument.</p>
<p>The finale (Allegro giocoso, ma non troppo vivace,
D major, 2-4) is a rondo on three themes, demanding
brilliant execution from the soloist. Compact in its formal
body, the movement ends in an elaborate coda. Fuller-Maitland
points out the Hungarian flavor of this finale,
&ldquo;as if a dedication to the great Hungarian violinist were
conveyed in it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic">&ldquo;Academic Festival Overture,&rdquo; Op. 80</h3>
<p>According to a plaque on the outer wall of a house at
Ischl in Upper Austria, &ldquo;the great tone poet Dr. Johannes
Brahms&rdquo; occupied the house for twelve summers. Indeed,
Brahms had a marked fondness for Ischl. In spite of the
fact that it was one of the most fashionable of spas and
that he disliked fashionable life, his attachment to the
town persisted, and in the aforesaid house, in the summer
of 1880, he composed two overtures, the &ldquo;Tragic&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Academic Festival.&rdquo; Notwithstanding the opus numbers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the &ldquo;Tragic&rdquo; was composed first and also performed
first.</p>
<p>The origin of the &ldquo;Academic Festival Overture&rdquo; is explained
by its name. The University of Breslau, on May
11, 1879, conferred on Brahms an honorary doctor&rsquo;s
degree. Though not a university man, Brahms had had
a taste of university life in 1853 when, with Remenyi, he
had paid a visit to Joachim, who was then at G&ouml;ttingen,
the university bitingly satirized by Heine. There, during
his stay of several weeks, he became familiar with the
songs best liked by the students. Nearly three decades
later the songs were present in his memory ready for use
in an overture intended as the composer&rsquo;s tribute to the
university honoring him.</p>
<p>Brahms himself conducted the first performance of the
&ldquo;Academic Festival Overture&rdquo; on January 4, 1881, at
Breslau, before an audience that included in the front
seats the Rector and Senate of the University and members
of the Philosophical Faculty. The honorary Doctor of
Philosophy, so often mystifying and coy about a new
composition, described the overture to Max Kalbeck, in
the autumn of 1880, as a &ldquo;very jolly potpourri on students&rsquo;
songs &agrave; la Supp&eacute;.&rdquo; When Kalbeck, a bit sarcastic, inquired
whether he had used the &ldquo;Fox Song&rdquo; (a freshman
song), he replied eagerly, &ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; Kalbeck, taken
aback, declared that he could not think of such academic
homage to the &ldquo;leathery Herr Rektor.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is also
wholly unnecessary,&rdquo; answered Brahms.</p>
<p>Minus an introduction, the overture (Allegro, C minor,
2-2) begins immediately with the principal subject given
out softly by the first violins. A quieter section follows,
the melody in the violas. The first of the students&rsquo; songs,
&ldquo;Wir hatten gebauet ein st&auml;ttliches Haus&rdquo; (&ldquo;We had built
a stately house, and trusted in God therein through bad
weather, storm, and horror&rdquo;), is impressively intoned by
the three trumpets (C major, 4-4).</p>
<p>The second students&rsquo; song, &ldquo;Der Landesvater&rdquo; (&ldquo;The
Father of the Country&rdquo;), appears in E major in the second
violins. The mood changes now to one of frank jollity
with the ragging of the freshman. The &ldquo;Fox Song,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Was kommt dort von der H&ouml;h&rdquo; (&ldquo;What Comes There
From On High&rdquo;), is introduced in G major by the two
bassoons to an accompaniment of violas and &rsquo;cellos. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
fourth and last students&rsquo; song, &ldquo;Gaudeamus Igitur,&rdquo;
famous wherever there are students the world over,
(Maestoso, C major, 3-4), is proclaimed by all the wind
against rushing scales in the upper strings, ending the
overture brilliantly.</p>
<h3 class="generic">&ldquo;Tragic Overture,&rdquo; Op. 81</h3>
<p>Although the &ldquo;Tragic Overture&rdquo; had a place on the
program of the concert in Breslau at which Brahms,
conducting, brought out the &ldquo;Academic Festival Overture&rdquo;,
the &ldquo;Tragic&rdquo; had already been played in Vienna at a
Philharmonic Concert on December 20, 1880, under the
direction of Hans Richter.</p>
<p>There has long been discussion as to what tragedy this
overture sets forth. It has been called &ldquo;a tragedy not of
actual happenings but of soul life. No hero, no event,
suggested program music or any specific musical portrayal,
although Hanslick says that if it be necessary to associate
the overture with a particular tragedy, that tragedy is
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo;.&rdquo; The Hamletians identify the second theme,
in F, with Ophelia and the episode in B-flat with Fortinbras.</p>
<p>It has also been said that though the composer denied
that in writing this work he had any specific tragedy in
mind, he may have received the impulse from a production
of Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; given by Franz von Dingelstedt in
1876 at the Burgtheater in Vienna, especially since
Dingelstedt had asked Brahms to consider supplying
incidental music and Brahms, it is said, had consented.
To some, then, this is a Faust overture.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is best to allow the overture to stand by
itself untroubled by the hazards of literary identification.
Heinrich Reimann finds in it the grandeur, the loftiness,
the deep earnestness of tragic character, &ldquo;Calamities,
which an inexorable fate had imposed on him, leave the
hero guilty; the tragic downfall atones for the guilt; this
downfall, which by purifying the passions and awakening
fear and pity works on the race at large, brings expiation
and redemption to the hero himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another biographer of Brahms, Dr. Hermann Deiters,
sums up the essence as follows: &ldquo;In this work we see a
strong hero battling with an iron and relentless fate;
passing hopes of victory cannot alter an impending
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
destiny. We do not care to inquire whether the composer
has a special tragedy in his mind, or if so, which one; those
who remain musically unconvinced by the unsurpassably
powerful theme would not be assisted by a particular
suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The overture opens (Allegro ma non troppo, D minor,
2-2) with two fortissimo chords, after which the strings
give out the first theme. The quieter second theme is
uttered by the violins. A more moderate section, in part
new and in part derived from earlier material, suggested
to Grove a funeral march.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in B-flat Major, No.2, Op. 83</h3>
<p>It took Brahms some time to complete his second piano
concerto. The first sketches were made on May 6, 1878,
at P&ouml;rtschach on the W&ouml;rthersee in southern Austria,
but the work was not finished till the summer of 1881,
when he gave it the finishing touches at Pressbaum, near
Vienna.</p>
<p>On the day of completion he wrote to his friends the
Herzogenbergs with his customary misleading humor:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that l have written a tiny, tiny
piano concerto with a tiny, tiny wisp of a scherzo.&rdquo; A
few days later he sent the four movements of the work to
another friend, Dr. Theodor Billroth, telling him, &ldquo;I am
sending you some small piano pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In October Hans von B&uuml;low, then director of the
Meiningen Orchestra, conducted at Brahms&rsquo;s request a
rehearsal of the concerto with Brahms as pianist. The
first public performance took place in Budapest at the
Redoutensaal on November 9, 1881. Alexander Erkel
was the conductor.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;tiny, tiny piano concerto&rdquo; or group of &ldquo;some
small piano pieces,&rdquo; as you prefer, is really a concerto
of exceptional dimensions. Not only has it the three
usual movements of the classical concerto, each large in
plan, but a highly developed scherzo (though it does not
bear that name).</p>
<p>The first movement (Allegro non troppo, B-flat major,
4-4) begins with the initial statement of the first subject
in dialogue for horn, piano, and woodwind.</p>

<p>A cadenza for the piano leads to a tutti, in which both the
first and the second subjects are given full play. The
development section is long and elaborate.</p>
<p>The fiery scherzo (Allegro appassionato, F major, 3-4)
Max Kalbeck believed had been written for the violin
concerto and then discarded. The piano gives out the
first theme fortissimo. The strings sing the second theme
tranquillo e dolce.</p>

</div>
<p>After a trio in D major, the first part is repeated, but much
altered.</p>
<p>The third movement (Andante, B-flat major, 6-4) opens
with an expressive melody, given first to a solo &rsquo;cello (an
instrument that has a particularly important part in this
movement), which resembles Brahms&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Immer leiser
wird mein Schlummer,&rdquo; not written, however, till 1886.
A second melody, introduced by piano and clarinet in F
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
sharp, recalls another song by Brahms, &ldquo;Todessehnen,&rdquo;
written in 1878. The first melody comes back in the &rsquo;cello
and dominates the coda, against trills and arpeggios in
the piano.</p>
<p>The finale (Allegretto grazioso, B flat major, 2-4) is a
rondo on a grand scale, the first of whose three themes
follows:</p>

<h3 class="generic">Symphony in F Major, No. 3, Op. 90</h3>
<p>Brahms finished the third of his symphonies at Wiesbaden
in the summer of 1883. In October he returned
to Vienna with the completed score, which he immediately
took to Hans Richter, by that time the conductor of
nearly everything in Vienna. Richter brought it out at a
Philharmonic Concert on December 2. The reception was
mixed. Though Brahms&rsquo;s adherents applauded fervently,
groups of Wagnerian followers of Anton Bruckner and
Hugo Wolf were there to hiss, and hiss they did! It remains
for Berlin, where Joachim conducted the second
performance of it anywhere at an Academy Concert on
January 4, 1884, to bestow the &ldquo;unqualified approval&rdquo;
that Brahms had written Hans von B&uuml;low he desired.</p>
<p>Such was the enthusiasm in Berlin that Brahms himself
conducted two more performances of the symphony there
later in the month, and he also conducted it successfully
at Wiesbaden on January 18. The triumph of triumphs,
however, came at Meiningen on February 4, when B&uuml;low
actually led the work twice through at the same concert,
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
and the repetition won an even greater ovation than the
first performance. Before the year 1884 was out the Third
Symphony had been performed in many places on the
Continent, in England, and in the United States, and
always with acclaim. Yet it annoyed Brahms that many
critics should pronounce this symphony by far the best
of his compositions. Expectations that he feared would
not be fulfilled were thus aroused, for Brahms, with all
his background of achievement, had in his nature a streak
of incorrigible modesty.</p>
<p>The adjective &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; has often been associated with
the Third Symphony of Brahms, as in its Italian form
&ldquo;eroica,&rdquo; it is attached to the Third Symphony of Beethoven.
Indeed, Richter, in a toast, christened this symphony,
while it was still in manuscript, Brahms&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eroica.&rdquo;
Hanslick, though concurring with Richter, points out that
the heroic quality is limited to the first and the last movements.
This &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; element, however, &ldquo;is without any
warlike flavor; it leads to no tragic action, such as the
Funeral March in Beethoven&rsquo;s &lsquo;Eroica.&rsquo; It recalls in its
musical character the healthy and full vigor of Beethoven&rsquo;s
second period, and nowhere the singularities of his last
period; and every now and then in passages quivers the
romantic twilight of Schumann and Mendelssohn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for Richter and Hanslick. Joachim discovered
a different heroism in the finale&mdash;nothing less than the
valiant fable of those antique lovers, Hero and Leander!
The second subject, in C major, with its rhythmic conflict
between four quarter notes to the measure and two groups
of triplets, he identified with the ardent swimmer battling
victoriously against the waves of the Hellespont.</p>
<p>Another view of the work is taken by Clara Schumann.
She called it a &ldquo;forest idyl,&rdquo; saying specifically of the
second movement: &ldquo;I feel as though I were watching the
worshippers round a little woodland chapel, the rippling
of the brooklet, the play of beetles and gnats&mdash;there is
such a swarming and whispering round about that one
feels all surrounded with the joys of nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first movement (Allegro con brio, F major, 6-4)
begins with a motto theme which at once suggests its
heroic character and recurs frequently. It consists of
three great ascending chords for horns, trumpets, and
woodwind, the top voice of which, F, A-flat, F, is said to
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
be emblematic of the &ldquo;Frei aber froh&rdquo; (&ldquo;Free but happy&rdquo;)
that Brahms had chosen as his personal motto. These
three notes are then used immediately as the bass against
which the real first subject comes streaming downwards
in the violins.</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig13">

<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img012.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>The second subject, in A major, is of a gracefully lyric
quality. Just before it enters there is an apparent allusion
to the Venusberg scene in &ldquo;Tannh&auml;user&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Naht euch
dem Strande, naht euch dem Lande&rdquo;&mdash;which Hugo
Riemann insists is an intentional tribute to Wagner,
who died while the symphony was taking shape in
Brahms&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>The second movement (Andante, C major, 4-4) opens
with a hymnlike theme, giving out by clarinets and
bassoons, which hints at a prayer heard in the overture
and again in the finale of Herold&rsquo;s opera &ldquo;Zampa.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig14">
<a href="music/img013.mid"><img src="images/img013.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="85" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img013.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>A second theme, in G major, with its typical Brahmsian
octaves and its air of hushed mystery, sustains Mme.
Schumann&rsquo;s woodland comparison.</p>
<p>The third movement (Poco allegretto, C minor, 3-8) is
not a scherzo, but a romanza touched with melancholy.
The first section is followed by a trio of similar mood,
after which the first section is repeated with changed
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
orchestration.</p>
<p>The finale (Allegro, F minor, 4-4) starts softly but
menacingly in the strings and bassoons. Subsidiary
material is employed before we hear the subject that
caused Joachim to think of Leander conquering the
Grecian waters. Whether or not Brahms had such an
idea in mind, this finale is a colossal struggle between
titanic powers, culminating in a tremendous climax.
Then peace and the major mode. With respect to this
tranquil coda Hanslick remarks: &ldquo;The raging ocean waves
calm down to a mysterious whisper. In an enigmatic
strangeness, in marvellous beauty, the whole thing dies
away....&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic">Symphony in E-Minor, No. 4, Op. 98</h3>
<p>When this symphony was brought out at Meiningen,
under the direction of Hans von B&uuml;low, on October 25,
1885, there was a great deal of discussion about the choice
of key and actually some dismay. E minor as the key for
a symphony was looked at askance, even though Haydn
and Raff had both used it. The suggestion has been made
that Brahms picked out E minor because of its &ldquo;pale, wan
character, to express the deepest melancholy.&rdquo; This key
has also been described as &ldquo;dull in color, shadowy, suggestive
of solitude and desolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haydn perhaps felt strongly the key&rsquo;s doleful implications,
for his E minor symphony is the &ldquo;Symphony of
Mourning.&rdquo; Raff&rsquo;s E minor symphony, on the other
hand, is by no means the autumnal affair that Brahms&rsquo;s
has been called. Its title, &ldquo;In Summer,&rdquo; tells us that!</p>
<p>Whatever the motives may have been that determined
Brahms&rsquo;s choice, it fell on E minor, and he proceeded to
compose. The work was written at M&uuml;rz-zu-Schlag in
Styria in the summers of 1884 and 1885. And at M&uuml;rz-zu-Schlag
in the latter year the manuscript was endangered
by fire. Brahms had gone out for a walk. On his return
he found that the house where he lodged was burning.
Fortunately he had devoted friends there who were
rushing his papers out of the building. Brahms pitched in
with the rest and helped get the fire under control. The
precious manuscript was saved.</p>
<p>Brahms, in spite of his mature years and all the important
work that he had put to his credit, was again
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
somewhat timid about a new symphony. In a letter to
Hans von B&uuml;low he described it, oddly enough, as &ldquo;a
couple of entr&rsquo;actes&rdquo;; he also termed it &ldquo;a choral work
without text.&rdquo; Yet he was eager for opinions from such
valued friends as Elisabeth von Herzogenberg and Clara
Schumann. He felt that the symphony had failed to
please a group of men, including Hanslick, Billroth,
Richter, Kalbeck, to whom he had played a four-hand
piano version with Ignaz Br&uuml;ll. To Kalbeck he said:
&ldquo;If persons like Billroth, Hanslick, and you do not like
my music, whom <i>will</i> it please?&rdquo; Had he forgotten
Elisabeth and Clara?</p>
<p>The audience that heard the Meiningen premi&egrave;re liked
the symphony. Indeed, a vain effort was made to have
the scherzo repeated. Nevertheless, the symphony was
slow in winning general favor. In Vienna, where Brahms
resided, it disappointed his friends and delighted his
enemies. Hugo Wolf, an arch-enemy, was then writing
musical criticism. He devoted a bitter article to the work,
in particular poking fun at the key&mdash;at last a symphony
in E minor! Brahms&rsquo;s friends, on the contrary, celebrated
the key, in order, it is said, to help cover up their disappointment
in the music. It was usual to hear the symphony
called grim, austere, forbidding, granitic. However,
eventually it made its way, and now there are those who
would rank it first among its author&rsquo;s four.</p>
<p>The initial theme of the first movement (Allegro non
troppo, E minor, 4-4), given out by the violins answered
by flutes, clarinets, and bassoons, is of a thoughtful and
somewhat mournful character, but it could hardly be
termed forbidding. Rather it invites to meditation. The
second theme, introduced by the wind instruments, is
harmonically and rhythmically one of Brahms&rsquo;s most
fascinating inspirations. Some undiscourageable seekers
after resemblances have discovered a likeness in the
thirteenth and fourteenth measures to a passage in the
second act of Puccini&rsquo;s opera &ldquo;Tosca,&rdquo; which followed
the symphony after fifteen years. Such resemblances are
often mere coincidences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The second movement (Andante moderato, E major,
6-8), with its unearthly melody announced in the Phrygian
mode by the horns, to be taken up immediately by oboes,
bassoons, and flutes,</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig15">
<a href="music/img014.mid"><img src="images/img014.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="190" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img014.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>has been called the most hauntingly beautiful page in all
of Brahms. Of this section Elisabeth von Herzogenberg
wrote to the composer: &ldquo;The Andante has the freshness
and distinction of character with which only you could
endow it, and even you have had recourse for the first
time to certain locked chambers of your soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kalbeck, who finds that the whole symphony pictures
the tragedy of human life, compares the Andante to a
waste and ruined field, like the Campagna (as it then was)
near Rome. But in the ensuing scherzo (Allegro giocoso,
C major, 4-4) he sees the Carnival at Milan. The finale
reminds him of a passage in the &ldquo;Oedipus Coloneus&rdquo; of
Sophocles: &ldquo;Not to have been born at all is superior
to every other view of the question.&rdquo; Yet there are those
who deny the pessimistic interpretation; who find a
rugged, full-blooded vigor in the finale as well as in the
scherzo, and who attribute the more specifically thoughtful
portions of the work to the reactions inevitable to any
sensitive and meditative spirit.</p>
<p>Be all that as it may, the finale (Allegro energico e
passionato, E minor, 3-4) is of special interest because
it is cast in the classic form of the passacaglia or chaconne.
It is built up on a majestic theme eight measures long,
a noble progression of chords, which recurs thirty-one
times, appearing in the high, middle, and low voices
alternately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<div class="img music" id="fig16">
<a href="music/img015.mid"><img src="images/img015.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="373" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img015.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>As to the distinction between those old, patrician dance
forms, passacaglia and chaconne, the doctors remain in
absolute contradiction, some maintaining a chaconne to
be what the others define as a passacaglia, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The curious may be interested to know that Simrock,
the music publisher, is said to have paid Brahms 40,000
marks for the symphony&mdash;the equivalent in 1885 of
$10,000.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the E minor symphony was the last of
Brahms&rsquo;s compositions that their author heard performed
in public. It was played at a Philharmonic Concert in
Vienna on March 7, 1897, less than a month before his
death. This was the last concert that Brahms, already
fatally ill, ever attended. Miss Florence May in her
&ldquo;Life of Brahms&rdquo; gives an affecting account of the occasion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fourth symphony had never become a favorite
work in Vienna. Received with reserve on its first performance,
it had not since gained much more from the
general public of the city than the respect sure to be accorded
there to an important work by Brahms. Today,
however, a storm of applause broke out at the end of
the first movement, not to be quieted until the composer,
coming to the front of the artists&rsquo; box in which he was
seated, showed himself to the audience. The demonstration
was renewed after the second and third movements,
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
and an extraordinary scene followed the conclusion of
the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The applauding, shouting house, its gaze riveted on
the figure standing in the balcony, so familiar and yet
in present aspect so strange, seemed unable to let him go.
Tears ran down his cheeks as he stood there, shrunken in
form, with lined countenance, strained expression, white
hair hanging lank: and through the audience there was
a feeling as of a stifled sob, for each knew that they were
saying farewell. Another outburst of applause and yet
another; one more acknowledgment from the master; and
Brahms and his Vienna had parted forever.&rdquo; He died
on April 3, 1897.</p>
<h3 class="generic">Concerto for Violin, Violoncello, and Orchestra in A Minor, Op. 102</h3>
<p>After the Fourth Symphony Brahms wrote only one
more work in which he employed the orchestra, the double
concerto for violin and &rsquo;cello. Thenceforth until his death
his creative activity was devoted to chamber music, piano
compositions, and songs for chorus or for solo voice.</p>
<p>This concerto he composed at Thun in Switzerland
during the summer of 1887. To Elisabeth von Herzogenberg
he referred to it in a letter of July 20: &ldquo;I can give you
nothing worth calling information about the undersigned
musician. True, he is now writing down something that
does not figure in his catalogue&mdash;but neither does it
figure in other persons&rsquo;! I leave you to guess the particular
form of idiocy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;particular form&rdquo; Walter Niemann calls an experiment
in the revival of the old Italian orchestral concerto,
the &ldquo;concerto grosso&rdquo; of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, so signally illustrated by Handel
and Bach, in which the orchestral tutti of the concerto
grosso is contrasted with a concertino for a group of
soloists.</p>
<p>But here Brahms was experimenting also with a curious
concertino consisting of a violin and a &rsquo;cello and with
unaccustomed combinations of instrumental timbres. In
effect his concerto grosso is distinctly late Brahms and
a far cry from the concerto grosso of musical antiquity.</p>
<p>Hardly was the double concerto completed before it
was performed privately at the Baden-Baden Kurhaus,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
Brahms conducting and Joachim and Robert Hausmann,
a distinguished &rsquo;cellist, playing the solo instruments.
The same artistic confraternity took part in the first
public performance, on October 18, 1887, at Cologne.
On a copy of the work that Brahms presented to Joachim
he wrote: &ldquo;To him for whom it was written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first movement (Allegro, A minor, 4-4) opens with
an introductory passage in which the orchestra alludes
to the chief subject and the &rsquo;cello follows with a rhapsodic
recitative. The woodwind give out in A major the initial
phrase of the second subject. Both subjects are heard
in the first tutti. A rising syncopated theme in F major
is also to be carefully noted.</p>
<p>The slow movement (Andante, D major, 3-4) is described
by Niemann as &ldquo;most lovely ... a great ballade,
steeped in the rich, mysterious tone of a northern evening
atmosphere.&rdquo; Four notes for the horns and woodwind
bring on the flowing chief melody</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig17">

</div>
<p>broadly sung by the solo instruments in octaves.</p>
<p>The finale (Vivace non troppo, A minor, 4-4), which
has been called the &ldquo;clearest of rondo types,&rdquo; abounds
in thematic material. The first subject</p>
<div class="img music" id="fig18">
<a href="music/img017.mid"><img src="images/img017.jpg" alt="music" width="600" height="186" /></a>
<p class="caption"><a class="ab" href="music/img017.mid">play music</a></p>
</div>
<p>announced by the &rsquo;cello and repeated by the violin, has
the gypsy flavor so dear to Brahms. It can be detected
in another melody assigned to the clarinets and bassoons
against rising arpeggios by the solo instruments, which
is prominent in the development. The coda, tender at
first and then exuberantly joyous, concludes the double
concerto, and at the same time the composer&rsquo;s employment
of the orchestra, in a triumphant A major.</p>
